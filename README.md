# Madatsara admin desktop

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), and [Electron packager](https://github.com/electron/electron-packager).

## Install

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/rabehasy/electron-react.tsara-admin.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd electron-react.tsara-admin
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```


## Usage

Both processes have to be started simultaneously in different console tabs

```bash
  npm run react:start
  npm run electron:start
```
This will start the application with hot-reload so you can instantly start developing your application.

## Packaging

We use [Electron packager](https://github.com/electron/electron-packager) to build and package the application. By default you can run the following to package for your current platform

```bash
  npm run build
```

## Installer

E.g for debian

```bash
  npm run debian:installer
```
